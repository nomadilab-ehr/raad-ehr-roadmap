# RAAD EHR ROADMAP
## Introduction
### Purpose of Roadmap
The purpose of the RAAD EHR roadmap is to provide a blueprint on the implementation and roll out of the RAAD EHR in Somalia, timeline, costs and the  anticipated plan of actions by the Federal and States Ministry of Health. The document gives guidance to implementers, users and funders on the work the Ministry of Health is carrying out, and the goals and objectives  intended to be achieved.

The EHR roadmap describes what has been achieved to-date and describes further on how the Federal and State Ministry of Health plans to better coordinate the expansion and integration into the health service delivery at all levels through setting up of ICT infrastructure, and the training of health workers in the use of ICT to improve efficiency of health services delivery.

The RAAD EHR system roadmap is a living document and will continue to receive regular updates on quarterly and annual basis given the dynamic nature of delivering health services, new learning and improvements from the pilot implementation, and the changes in the technology. 


### Background & Current Status
Somalia is emerging from decades of conflict which destroyed government institutions and the
social and economic infrastructure of the country, resulting in the absence of government control, oversight, and funding of the basic social services such as health and education. After years of statelessness, a provisional constitution was adopted in 2011 which paved the way for the establishment of the current Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and its subsequent formal recognition by the international community in 2012. 

The health sector, like the other social service sectors, is recovering from the disintegration and
dysfunction of state institutions. The Ministry of Health Somalia realizing the importance of reliable data in decision-making, efforts of rebuilding HIS had commenced with the conception of the EPHS in 2009 as the main vehicle of health service delivery. Subsequently, the first Somalia post-civil war Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP I) laid the foundation for development of the public health management information system in 2013. The plan provided strategic directions and established a public health sector information management system to capture a core set of health data indicators with health facilities as primary sources of data.
Subsequently, in collaboration with development partners, MoH in 2017 adopted a DHIS2-based M&E system to provide data management functions on collection, analysis and reporting of quality health data for health programs.

Despite the challenges, over the past decade, the implementation of information systems strategic interventions have transformed ways in which health data and information is collected, stored, analyzed and disseminated at state and regional governance levels. Somalia HMIS has been at the forefront of this transformation on the collection, analysis, and use of health information for evidence decision making. 

While the implementation of the Somalia HMIS on the DHIS2 platform has improved the reporting flow from health facilities to district/state/federal levels, a critical challenge persists at the health facility level. Patient data collection and management still rely on cumbersome and error-prone paper-based methods, primarily using registers. This approach has resulted in various data quality issues, including underreporting, incomplete records, and occasional inaccuracies. Furthermore, the paper-based system is time-consuming, difficult to maintain, and susceptible to data entry errors and illegible handwriting, highlighting the need for a more efficient and reliable data management solution.

Through the Health Alliance for Digital Development and Action (HADDA) program support to the Ministry of Health on enhancing Somalia's digital health information system. The primary objective of the program is to strengthen the Ministry of Health in Somalia HIS systems to report accurate and dependable information that can serve as the foundation for decision-making at both the Federal and Member State levels

HADDA's approach is based on the findings and recommendations derived from the baseline Health Information System (HIS) assessment. 
The program identified specific areas of focus, which include:

* Digitalization of HMIS (Health Management Information System) tools at the health facility: Support digitalizing the tools and systems used in  health facilities. This digitalization aims to streamline patient level data collection, management, and reporting within the healthcare system, making it more efficient and accurate.

* Strengthening Stewardship and Governance Capacity: Enhance the ability of the Ministries of Health (both at the federal and state levels) to effectively manage the digital health information system. This includes improving their governance capacity, ensuring data security, and enabling efficient data utilization for informed decision-making.

RAAD EHR implementation is introduced as a solution to the digitalization of the HMIS tools to improve the use, reporting, and data quality at healthcare facilities. This will help healthcare providers maintain patient records, streamline clinical processes, and ensure interoperability with the broader Health Management Information System (HMIS). The RAAD EHR  will support the following areas:

1. Outpatient and Inpatient Services.

2. Program-specific services (TB, HIV/AIDS).

3. Integrated public health and clinical surveillance.

4. Registration and management of patients/clients' information.

5. Clinical management.

6. Pharmacy/medication management.

7. Lab management.

8. Data management, reporting, and data analysis.

9. Clinical decision support.

10. Integration with other software platforms such as DHIS2.

The development of the RAAD EHR will be built on experience and lessons learnt from implementing systems such as the Somalia HMIS, and other digital collection tools(ONA, etc), to come up with an EHR that works within the local health facility environment. This system will need to take into account technical and infrastructural constraints as well as the skills of the intended primary users of the system.


### EHR Objectives

The overall goal of the RAAD EHR development and deployment is to implement a standards-based, interoperable, patient-centric system that supports end-to-end patient care and management across the continuum of care.

### EHR Justification

The implementation of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system is essential for enhancing health service delivery and improving patient outcomes. Currently, the reliance on paper-based systems for patient management is not only inefficient but also prone to errors and delays, leading to significant gaps in reporting critical health indicators. This under-reporting hampers the ability to make evidence-based decisions, which are crucial for effective planning, resource allocation, and disease control.

An EHR system ensures accurate, real-time data collection, enabling health facilities to streamline patient management, enhance surveillance, and improve program-specific reporting. It also strengthens the integration with national health platforms like DHIS2, allowing for timely, comprehensive data reporting. Moreover, EHRs provide a centralized and secure way to manage patient information, reducing duplication, improving care coordination, and supporting long-term health planning.

In a healthcare system increasingly driven by data, the shift from paper-based records to a digital infrastructure is vital. An EHR not only improves operational efficiency but also fosters a culture of accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement across healthcare facilities, paving the way for better health outcomes and informed decision-making at all levels.

### Deployment Team

The deployment of the EHR involves two specialized teams: network engineers and EHR implementation experts. The network team is responsible for establishing the health facility's network infrastructure to support the EHR system, while the EHR implementation team focuses on installing the EHR on the local server and providing on-site training and support.

Following the launch of the RAAD EHR at the health facility, a minimum of two experienced support personnel (EHR and network specialists) oversee the system's implementation during the initial 2 to 3 weeks post-deployment. The support and mentorship team gradually reduces their on-site presence as health workers gain confidence in using the system. Additionally, the team provides remote support and addresses any issues or challenges that the health facilities encounter.

### Cost Estimate of Implementation

RAAD EHR can be implemented in three tailored configurations, each designed to align with the unique size and operational requirements of healthcare facilities: 

- Full RAAD Setup

### Quality Management Plan

In the system development phase, well-tested methodologies and techniques are employed to guarantee the creation of a high-quality product. Following each development sprint or iteration, new functionalities are initially tested by testing engineers. Subsequently, these features are presented to users for acceptance testing. This process ensures that every new feature aligns with user requirements and delivers the intended outcomes.

Training sessions employ an interactive and blended learning approach, combining on-site training, recorded demonstration videos/walkthroughs, and an EHR end-user manual. This comprehensive method ensures that the team gains an in-depth understanding of the system for effective use. In addition, feedback from the training sessions on the system improvement or bugs is incorporated into the system’s future releases. 

Supportive and mentoring visits are regularly conducted to ensure that the system is being used properly and to mentor any trainee/users in areas where they lack confidence. A WhatsApp platform has also been set up for EHR users to share knowledge among themselves and other support personnel.

### Risk Management Plan
The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to identify, assess, and manage potential risks that could impact the successful implementation of the RAAD EHR system in Somalia. It aims to minimize the negative impacts on project timelines, costs, and deliverables while maximizing the opportunities to meet the objectives effectively.

The risks can be categorized into the following areas: technical, operational, security,legal, financial, human resources/staffing, and external risks.

#### A. Risk Identification and Assessment Methodology
Each identified risk will be categorized by its impact and likelihood using a risk matrix to prioritize them for action. 
The matrix categorizes risks into:

* Low Risk: Minor impact and/or unlikely to occur.

* Moderate Risk: Manageable impact but requires monitoring.

* High Risk: Likely to occur and can have severe consequences.

* Critical Risk: Imminent or highly impactful risks that must be mitigated immediately.
