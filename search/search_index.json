After years of statelessness, a provisional constitution was adopted in 2011 which paved the way for the establishment of the current Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and its subsequent formal recognition by the international community in 2012. </p> <p>The health sector, like the other social service sectors, is recovering from the disintegration and dysfunction of state institutions. The Ministry of Health Somalia realizing the importance of reliable data in decision-making, efforts of rebuilding HIS had commenced with the conception of the EPHS in 2009 as the main vehicle of health service delivery. Subsequently, the first Somalia post-civil war Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP I) laid the foundation for development of the public health management information system in 2013. The plan provided strategic directions and established a public health sector information management system to capture a core set of health data indicators with health facilities as primary sources of data. Subsequently, in collaboration with development partners, MoH in 2017 adopted a DHIS2-based M&amp;E system to provide data management functions on collection, analysis and reporting of quality health data for health programs.</p> <p>Despite the challenges, over the past decade, the implementation of information systems strategic interventions have transformed ways in which health data and information is collected, stored, analyzed and disseminated at state and regional governance levels. Somalia HMIS has been at the forefront of this transformation on the collection, analysis, and use of health information for evidence decision making. </p> <p>While the implementation of the Somalia HMIS on the DHIS2 platform has improved the reporting flow from health facilities to district/state/federal levels, a critical challenge persists at the health facility level. Patient data collection and management still rely on cumbersome and error-prone paper-based methods, primarily using registers. This approach has resulted in various data quality issues, including underreporting, incomplete records, and occasional inaccuracies. Furthermore, the paper-based system is time-consuming, difficult to maintain, and susceptible to data entry errors and illegible handwriting, highlighting the need for a more efficient and reliable data management solution.</p> <p>Through the Health Alliance for Digital Development and Action (HADDA) program support to the Ministry of Health on enhancing Somalia's digital health information system. The primary objective of the program is to strengthen the Ministry of Health in Somalia HIS systems to report accurate and dependable information that can serve as the foundation for decision-making at both the Federal and Member State levels</p> <p>HADDA's approach is based on the findings and recommendations derived from the baseline Health Information System (HIS) assessment.  The program identified specific areas of focus, which include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Digitalization of HMIS (Health Management Information System) tools at the health facility: Support digitalizing the tools and systems used in  health facilities. This digitalization aims to streamline patient level data collection, management, and reporting within the healthcare system, making it more efficient and accurate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strengthening Stewardship and Governance Capacity: Enhance the ability of the Ministries of Health (both at the federal and state levels) to effectively manage the digital health information system. This includes improving their governance capacity, ensuring data security, and enabling efficient data utilization for informed decision-making.</p> </li> </ul> <p>RAAD EHR implementation is introduced as a solution to the digitalization of the HMIS tools to improve the use, reporting, and data quality at healthcare facilities. This will help healthcare providers maintain patient records, streamline clinical processes, and ensure interoperability with the broader Health Management Information System (HMIS). The RAAD EHR  will support the following areas:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Outpatient and Inpatient Services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Program-specific services (TB, HIV/AIDS).</p> </li> <li> <p>Integrated public health and clinical surveillance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Registration and management of patients/clients' information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clinical management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pharmacy/medication management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lab management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data management, reporting, and data analysis.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clinical decision support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration with other software platforms such as DHIS2.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The development of the RAAD EHR will be built on experience and lessons learnt from implementing systems such as the Somalia HMIS, and other digital collection tools(ONA, etc), to come up with an EHR that works within the local health facility environment. This system will need to take into account technical and infrastructural constraints as well as the skills of the intended primary users of the system.</p>"},{"location":"home/#ehr-objectives","title":"EHR Objectives","text":"<p>The overall goal of the RAAD EHR development and deployment is to implement a standards-based, interoperable, patient-centric system that supports end-to-end patient care and management across the continuum of care.

Currently, the reliance on paper-based systems for patient management is not only inefficient but also prone to errors and delays, leading to significant gaps in reporting critical health indicators. This under-reporting hampers the ability to make evidence-based decisions, which are crucial for effective planning, resource allocation, and disease control.</p> <p>An EHR system ensures accurate, real-time data collection, enabling health facilities to streamline patient management, enhance surveillance, and improve program-specific reporting. It also strengthens the integration with national health platforms like DHIS2, allowing for timely, comprehensive data reporting. Moreover, EHRs provide a centralized and secure way to manage patient information, reducing duplication, improving care coordination, and supporting long-term health planning.</p> <p>In a healthcare system increasingly driven by data, the shift from paper-based records to a digital infrastructure is vital. An EHR not only improves operational efficiency but also fosters a culture of accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement across healthcare facilities, paving the way for better health outcomes and informed decision-making at all levels.</p>"},{"location":"home/#ehr-advantages","title":"EHR Advantages","text":"<p>Electronic Health Records(EHRs) provide the ability to exchange health information digitally, enabling higher quality and safer care for patients/clients.
